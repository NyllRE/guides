* Problem
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

- You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

** Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

** demonstration:
[
+1+ * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24,
1 * +2+ * 3 * 4 = 12,
1 * 2 * +3+ * 4 = 8,
1 * 2 * 3 * +4+ = 6
]
